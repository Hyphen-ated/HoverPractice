Hover Practice v0.1

This is a practice tool for doing the Hover glitch in The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past.

In order to hover, you have to press your dash button for 30 or fewer frames, then release that button for one single
frame before pressing it again, and then repeat this process until you're done hovering.

The tool watches for any gamepad button presses and draws two bars for each one. On top, it shows you how long you held
down the button. Below, it shows you how long you had the button released. If both bars are green, that means you did
a successful hover input. The goal is to reliably have long stretches of all green.
