This is a practice tool for doing the Hover glitch in The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past.

[Download it here](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/HoverPractice/releases) (get the latest file that doesn't have
"source code" in the name).

In order to hover, you have to press your dash button for 30 or fewer frames, then release that button for one single
frame before pressing it again, and then repeat this process until you're done hovering. Normally people do this by scraping two fingernails back and forth across the button; the gap in between the fingers is when the button gets released.

The tool draws two bars for each time you press the dash button. On top, it shows you how long you held
down the button. Below, it shows you how long you had the button released. If both bars are green, that means you did
a successful hover input. The goal is to reliably have long stretches of all green.

Each time you start the tool, it asks what your dash button is. You can use any controller button or keyboard key.
If you use a controller, you can also press down on a dpad or stick to see Link move.
